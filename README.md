# RSA-Factoring-Challenge


The **RSA Factoring Challenge** was a challenge put forward by [RSA Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Laboratories "RSA Laboratories") on March 18, 1991 to encourage research into [computational number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_number_theory "Computational number theory") and the practical difficulty of [factoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization "Factorization") large [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") and cracking [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)) "RSA (algorithm)") keys used in [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography"). They published a list of [semiprimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiprime "Semiprime") (numbers with exactly two [prime factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor "Prime factor")) known as the [RSA numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers "RSA numbers"), with a cash prize for the successful factorization of some of them. The smallest of them, a 100-decimal digit number called [RSA-100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA-100 "RSA-100") was factored by April 1, 1991. Many of the bigger numbers have still not been factored and are expected to remain unfactored for quite some time, however advances in [quantum computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computer "Quantum computer") make this prediction uncertain due to [Shor&#39;s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm "Shor's algorithm").

In 2001, RSA Laboratories expanded the factoring challenge and offered prizes ranging from $10,000 to $200,000 for factoring numbers from 576 bits up to 2048 bits.

The RSA Factoring Challenges ended in 2007. RSA Laboratories stated: "Now that the industry has a considerably more advanced understanding of the cryptanalytic strength of common [symmetric-key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_key_algorithm "Symmetric key algorithm") and [public-key algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_algorithm "Public key algorithm"), these challenges are no longer active."
When the challenge ended in 2007, only RSA-576 and RSA-640 had been factored from the 2001 challenge numbers.
